# CashP - PHP library for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and SLP token payments
This is a PHP library to enable [BitCoin Cash (BCH)](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) and [SLP token](https://simpleledger.cash/) payments.
You can easily use this with WordPress, Laravel and other PHP frameworks.

#### Installation
With composer (recommended):
```
composer require "ekliptor/cashp"
```

Manual installation:

1. Download the source code and include `cashp.php` from the root directory of this library.
2. Download the source of this [PHP QR-code package](https://github.com/Ekliptor/qr-code) and extract it to `src/phpqrcode`

#### Requirements
```
PHP >= 7.1
```

## Features
* on-chain payments without going through a 3rd party
* configurable open-source [REST API backend](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/rest.bitcoin.com)
* 1-time address generation for payments using xPub (so your wallet's private key is not stored on the server)
* generate QR codes with BCH and SLP payment URIs

## Docs
Take a look at [code examples](https://github.com/Ekliptor/cashp/tree/master/examples).

#### CashP class
##### __construct(CashpOptions $options = null)

* `float $amountToken` - (optional) The amount of the optional token to be received.
* `string $tokenID` - (optional) The hex ID of the SLP token. Required if $amountToken > 0.

returns `bool` - true on success, false otherwise

---

##### createPaymentURI(string $address, float $amountBCH, float $amountToken = 0.0, string $tokenID = ""): string
Return a payment URI (starting with "bitcoincash:" or "simpleledger:" if $amountToken > 0) for the given $address.
* `string $address` - The receiving BCH (or SLP) address.
* `float $amountBCH` - The amount in BCH to receive.
* `float $amountToken` - (optional) The amount of SLP tokens to receive.
* `string $tokenID` - (optional) The hex ID of the SLP token. Required if $amountToken > 0.

returns `string`

---

##### getBadgerButton(array $btnConf, string $address, float $amountBCH, float $amountToken = 0.0, string $tokenID = ""): string
Get the HTML code of a BadgerButton. See https://badger.bitcoin.com/
* `array $btnConf` - associative array with buttom config
    * text (string) The text of the button
    * callback (string, optional) The name of a callback function present on the global window to be called after payment. Parameters: string chainTxID
    * cssClass (string, optional) Additional CSS classes for the button.
    * forceIndludeJs (bool, optional) default false - Include the JavaScript library again. Only use this if you are generating HTML for multiple pages.
* `string $address` - The receiving BCH (or SLP) address.
* `float $amountBCH` - The amount in BCH to receive.
* `float $amountToken` - (optional) The amount of SLP tokens to receive.
* `string $tokenID` - (optional) The hex ID of the SLP token. Required if $amountToken > 0.

returns `string` - The button HTML.

---

##### isValidBchAddress(string $bchAddress): bool
Check if a BCH address is valid.
* `string $bchAddress` - The address in CashAddress format starting with 'bitcoincash:'

returns `bool` - True if the address is valid, false otherwise.

---

##### isValidSlpAddress(string $slpAddress): bool
Check if a SLP address is valid.
* `string $slpAddress` - The address starting with 'simpleledger:'

returns `bool` - True if the address is valid, false otherwise.

---


#### CashpOptions class
A set of advanced config properties.
* `$httpAgent = null` - The HTTP implementation used to make HTTP requests.
Values: BasicHttpAgent|CurlHttpAgent|WordpressHttpAgent
Defaults to BasicHttpAgent, but you should use a better one according to your PHP setup.
* `$exchangeRateExpirationMin = 60` - How long the crawled exchange rate shall stay in cache. Currently rates are not saved beyond script execution.
* `$httpTimeoutSec = 10` - The timeout for HTTP requests to the REST API backend.
* `$blockchainApiImplementation = "BitcoinComRestApi"` - The REST API backend implementation to use. Allowed values: BitcoinComRestApi


#### ExchangeRate class
An API to get BCH exchanges rates to fiat currencies.

##### getRate(string $currency = "USD"): float
Get the current exchange rate for BCH.
* `string $currency` - A fiat currency such as USD|EUR|JPY

returns `float`

---


#### BlockchainApi class

## Testing
To run unit tests type the following command in the project root directory (requires PHPUnit, installed automatically with Composer):

`./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests`


## ToDo
* add SLP address verification
* implement more functions of the REST API
* implement address creation using xPub with SLPDB (after it's supported)
